# SAN and PresRAID Startup and Shutdown

## SAN Startup

1. Power up the SAN by pressing the power button on the front right-hand side of the server. Note, the SAN should be plugged into a UPS ideally.
2. Wait about 15 minutes for things to start up.
3. Go to the SAN management GUI at: https://192.168.253.61:8088. Login credentials can be found on OnePassword.
4. Once logged in, go to the VM (Virtual Machine) Tab on the right side of the browse window. If the tab doesn't appear, wait 5 to 10 minutes and refresh the page.
5. Click the VM icon at the bottom of the screen (image attached) to enter the View and Management control panel.

* The organization of it is pretty straightforward, but keep in mind the naming convention for folders and files require consistency in order for the scripts to locate the files and work their magic. It is best to copy & paste templates (located on the **SAN**) for this reason.

## Create a New Client Folder
* Note: The project folder name should match the **Salesforce** Opportunity Name.
* Create a client folder on the **SAN** using the naming convention **PV**(Last two digits of current year) followed by an underscore and the project name.
    - Example: *PV20_BeyonceKnowles*
* The **PAP** naming convention follows the same rule, replacing **PV**(year) with **PAP**(current round).
    - Example: *PAP12_BeyonceKnowles*
* Copy the folders located under **ProjectTemplate** and paste them under the newly created client folder.

## Keeping Up With Storage
* Keep an eye on the amount of storage left on the SAN.  Anytime the amount of available space drops below 7 TB, then files will need to be QC'd and loaded to drives, deleted, or moved before much more can be added.
* Low space can cause playback issues with the files already stored there.
* Empty the **TrashCan** on the **SAN** every morning by dragging the trashed files to your desktop's trashcan and selecting EMPTY TRASH.

## SAN Troubleshooting

* Other documentation is only accessible to employees who can access the Preservation Team Drive or via the IT/OPS team.  See a manager or someone from IT if you discover any problems that require immediate attention.
