# Enrolling Participants In A Course

The Preservation Course is private, since it's a free course and we don't un-vetted users to enroll in th course. When you have found someone that you want to enroll in the course, you need to ask them to create an account on the Learnworlds platform. Once they've done so, you can follow these steps to enroll them in the class:

* Log into Learnworlds as an Admin
* Click on the Users icon on the left bar
* Select "All Users"
* Use the search bar to find the user you want to added
* On the right side of the screen there's a column named "Manage". when you hover over this column you'll see two icons appear, one is a pencil, and one is an elipse (...). Hover over the elipse and click the option "Enroll To Product"
* Select the class you'd like to enroll them in
* Add the date and your name to the Justification field
* Click "Enroll User"

That's it! The participant will now receive an email that links them to the course. You can also reach out manually any let them know they're been enrolled.
