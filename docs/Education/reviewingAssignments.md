# Reviewing Assignments

Reviewing Assignments is remarkably easy using Learnworlds. This article will describe the ideal workflow for reviewing students' assignments and providing feedback for an asynchronous class.

In order to follow any of these steps you'll need to be logged in as an admin an on BAVC's Learnworlds page. you can access the page at either of the following URLs

* [learn.bavc.org]("learn.bavc.org")
* [bavc.mylearnworlds.com]("bavc.mylearnworlds.com")

# Assignment Setup

First, you'll need to [create assignments](https://bavc.github.io/bavc-resources/docs/Education/createCourse.html#Creating-Assignments). Once you have an assignment created you'll need to make sure that it is set up to allow "Manual Feedback" and that only 100% grades count as a pass. Here are the steps to do this:

* Click on _Courses_ icon on the left-hand side
* Select the course you want to edit from the list. Probably the one named _Hands-On Training with Analog Video Playback Equipment_
* Select _Content_ along the top bar
* Find the Assignemnt or Exam you want to edit. However over it and press the button that says _Edit questions_
* Hover over _Settings_ along the top bar and then select _Manual Feedback_
* Make sure that _Enable Manual Feedback_ is set to _Yes_
* Select the _Grades & Attempts_ menu
* Set _Passing Grade_ to _100%_
* Select _Save & Close_

You'll need to do this for every assignmnt that you want to provide manual feedback for. However, if you do this while you create the assignment you don't need to worry about it again (you only need to do it once!)

# Student Feedback Notifications Setup

Students wil receive feedback as a message in their Learnworlds inbox. They should also receive an email notification about it as long as their notification settings are properly setup. To make sure these are correct, do this:

* Click on _Settings_ icon on the left-hand side
* Select _Notifications Email_
* Select _Learner Settings_
* Make sure that _On review submission_ is checked
* Click _Save_


# Review Workflow

## Finding Assignments To Grade

You should receive notification whenever a user completes an assignment. However, since notifications can be sketchy it's a good idea to check the _Review Center_ for any ungraded assignemnts on a regular basis (every Tuesday and Friday possibly). To check the review center do the following:

* Click on the _Reports Center_ icon on the left-hand side
* Select _Review Center_
* Near the top of the page there's a dropdown that says _All Course_. Click on that and select the course you want to grade assignemnts for to show only assignments for that course (in this case, _Hands-On Training with Analog Video Playback Equipment_)
* If you select _Unreviewed/Ungraded_ at the top, you will see only the completed assignments in need of grading


You will now be able to see all the assignmetns that need grading. Click on the small clipboard icon in the column named _Manage_ to grade and provide feedback for the selected assignment.

## Grading Assignments

Learnworlds asks for a percentage grade for each question. Most questions are pass fail, so you'll need to fill out either _0_ or _100_ for each answer. 0 is a fail and 100 is a pass. If there is a multipart question and the particiapnt gets a part correct and a part wrong you can give them fractional credit, but this isn't super important.

Learnworlds allows you to provide feedback for each question, and for the assignemnt overall. You do not need to provide feedback for correct answers, but you must provide feedback for incorrect answers. Reference the [Teacher's Guide Answers document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ijBiEvhQojaQVJQbmCNge8EBkZmUIt8oeQdlQAgkf4/edit?usp=sharing) to see what the correct answers should be. Please provide thorough feedback for any incorrect answers.

The overall assignment feedback should have the following information:

* If the participant got everything correct, let them know they did a great job and that they can move on.
* If there are any incorrect answers, ask them to review the feedback for those answers. You can also remind them of when the next office hours session is so that they can attend for more insight
* If they got everything correct but there is some indication that they don't fully understand the materials you should remind them that they can attend office hours.

Once you have filled out the feedback fields you can press _Submit Review_.

With that, the review is complete!
