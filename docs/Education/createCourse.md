#Creating Assignments and Learning Materials

To create an assignment you'll need to first [create a Course]([create assignemnts](https://bavc.github.io/bavc-resources/docs/Education/createcourse.html). Once you have the course created, you can edit the course by selected the _Course_ icon on the left side of the screen, then selecting the course you want to edit from the list that appears.

Once you have the course you want to edit selected, press the _Contents_ tab at the top to see all of the course materials and assignments. You need to add _Sections_ to the course. To add a section hover over the edit icon (a black square with a pen in it) and the options will expand. Press the + sign that says _Add Section Below_ to add a section.

Our current preservation class has a section for each Module. You can organize the class any way you like, but this is how we choose to do it.

##Creating Assignments

Once you have the sections you want created, you can press the _Add Activity_ at the bottom of the section you want to add the assignment to. This will open a new window with a number of options for different activities. For an assigemnt, you want to press the _Exam_ section on the left side of the window, then press _Blank Assignemnt_. This will create a blank assignment that you can add questions to from scratch.

After pressing this button a new line will be added to the section. You'll need to type in the name of the assignment, then press _Save & Edit_. Now, the exam editing window will appear.

From here you can add sections and questions to the exam.
