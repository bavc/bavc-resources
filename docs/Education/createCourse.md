#Creating Assignments and Learning Materials

To create an assignment you'll need to first [create a Course](https://bavc.github.io/bavc-resources/docs/Education/createcourse.html). Once you have the course created, you can edit the course by selected the _Course_ icon on the left side of the screen, then selecting the course you want to edit from the list that appears.

Once you have the course you want to edit selected, press the _Contents_ tab at the top to see all of the course materials and assignments. You need to add _Sections_ to the course. To add a section hover over the edit icon (a black square with a pen in it) and the options will expand. Press the + sign that says _Add Section Below_ to add a section.

Our current preservation class has a section for each Module. You can organize the class any way you like, but this is how we choose to do it.

##Creating Assignments

Once you have the sections you want created, you can press the _Add Activity_ at the bottom of the section you want to add the assignment to. This will open a new window with a number of options for different activities. For an assigemnt, you want to press the _Exam_ section on the left side of the window, then press _Blank Assignemnt_. This will create a blank assignment that you can add questions to from scratch.

After pressing this button a new line will be added to the section. You'll need to type in the name of the assignment, then press _Save & Edit_. Now, the exam editing window will appear.

From here you can add sections and questions to the exam.

##Assignment Settings

Once you have an assignment created you'll need to make sure that it is set up to allow "Manual Feedback" and that only 100% grades count as a pass. Here are the steps to do this:

* Click on _Courses_ icon on the left-hand side
* Select the course you want to edit from the list. Probably the one named _Hands-On Training with Analog Video Playback Equipment_
* Select _Content_ along the top bar
* Find the Assignemnt or Exam you want to edit. However over it and press the button that says _Edit questions_
* Hover over _Settings_ along the top bar and then select _Manual Feedback_
* Make sure that _Enable Manual Feedback_ is set to _Yes_
* Select the _Grades & Attempts_ menu
* Set _Passing Grade_ to _100%_
* Select _Save & Close_

##Creating Learning Materials

Learning materials like instructional videos and materials can be added to sections in a similar way.

###Instructional Videos

To add an instructional video, you'll first need to add the video to the course's video library. To do this, click the _Video Library_ tab at the top of the course editor window. Then press the _Add video_ button. From there you simply select the file you want to upload and add it. Once you do that you'll see the video begin to upload to the page. When the upload is complete, you can press the edit button (black square with a pen in it) that appears over the video when you hover over the thumbnail. This will open an editing pane you can use to rename the video.

Once the file is uploaded and renamed (renaming is not necessary, but helpful), you can go back to the Course Contents page. From this page, press the _Add Activity_ button and select _Video (interactive)_. From here, a new line will be added to the section. Give the video a name, then press _Save & Edit_.

Now, hover of the video that was added and press _Settings_. A pane will open up where you can edit the name of the video as it appears in the course. Then, select the radio button titled _From course video library_, which allows you to select the video that you uploaded to the Video Library to the course from a dropdown menu. Once you've selected the video that you added, press _Save_ at the bottom of the pane and the pane will close.

Now, if you hover over the video activity in the Course Content page again a new button will appear that says _Edit video_. Click on this button to enter the edit window. From this window you can add interactions, thumbnails, and closed captioning. So far we're only using closed captioning.

All instructional videos should have subtitles / closed captioning. If you don't have subtitles, check out [this article on using Sonix.AI](https://bavc.github.io/bavc-resources/docs/Technical%20Documentation/creatingSubtitles.html) to create a subtitles file. Learnworlds accepts SRT files, so make sure to export an SRT file from Sonix.

Once you have an SRT file to go along with the video, click the _Subtitles_ menu on the right side of the window. Here you can upload the SRT file to the Learnworlds. If this is all done properly, the participants should be able to toggle the closed captioning on and off as the video plays.

Once you've finished adjusting the settings, press _Save_ and _<_ to return to the Course Content window. If you're happy with everything, you can press _Save_ again to save the changes you've made to the course.

###Reading Materials

Reading materials are added much the same. Go to the section you want to add them to and click _Add activity_. You can then add eBooks, PDFs, or YouTube links. For our class we've consolidated all of the reading materials into one single PDF. This is because any materials added to the course count towards the participant's completion. Since these reading materials are optional, we don't want unopened/unread materials counting against the participant's completion of the class. To get around this, we added all the materials as a single PDF, so if they click on it once it looks like all of the materials were viewed.
