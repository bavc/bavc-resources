#Creating Assignemnts




Once you have an assignment created you'll need to make sure that it is set up to allow "Manual Feedback" and that only 100% grades count as a pass. Here are the steps to do this:

* Click on _Courses_ icon on the left-hand side
* Select the course you want to edit from the list. Probably the one named _Hands-On Training with Analog Video Playback Equipment_
* Select _Content_ along the top bar
* Find the Assignemnt or Exam you want to edit. However over it and press the button that says _Edit questions_
* Hover over _Settings_ along the top bar and then select _Manual Feedback_
* Make sure that _Enable Manual Feedback_ is set to _Yes_
* Select the _Grades & Attempts_ menu
* Set _Passing Grade_ to _100%_
* Select _Save & Close_
