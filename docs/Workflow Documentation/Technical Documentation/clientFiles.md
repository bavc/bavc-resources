# Sharing Client Files via Google Drive

* Our current method for supplying clients with Google Drive is not very secure. Ergo, you must do this sparingly, only when time-sensitive retrieval is needed by the client. Files should only be available for 48 hours and then removed from the Google Drive once you can ensure that the files have been downloaded.

    - Log Into Google Drive using the preservation@gmail.com account
    - Navigate to the Preservation Files for Clients folder
    - Create a new folder based off of the Opportunity Name
    - Drag in the typical BAVC_Preservation delivery folder
    - Drag in the files into their appropriate folders
    - Share the main folder with the client's email
    - Email the client and tell them they have 48 hours to download the files.
