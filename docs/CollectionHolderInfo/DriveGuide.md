## File Size Estimates

You can estimate size you need if you know the duration of the your tapes and what format you'll be receiving:
* 10-Bit Uncompressed (Preservation) -> 100gb/hr
* Lossless Compressed FFV1 / Matroska (Preservation) -> 40gb/hr
* ProRes 422 HQ (Mezzanine) -> 30gb/hr
* H.264 / MP4  (Access) -> 1gb/hr

If you'd like a more accurate estimate you can reach out to us and we will create one for you.

Once you have your size estimate, make sure you that you won't fill your hard drive above 85% capacity.
