# Barcodes and Filenames: What You Need To Know

## Barcodes at BAVC

During ingest BAVC will afix a small (1.5" x 0.75") barcode to each tape and tape case. We use these labels for processing the tape and its associated files during our assessment, transfer, and quality control workflows. These barcodes do not damage or harm the tape or inhibit its playback. However, if you prefer that we do not affix these barcodes to your tapes we're happy to skip this step in the process.

For small-format tapes, such as Hi8 and MiniDV, the larger barcode stickers are trimmed down and only the 7-digit number is affixed to the tape.

## Filenames at barcodes

We name the digital files we create from your tapes after the bacodes that we affix to the tapes. If your tapes have a unique identifier on them (such as a catalogin number, accession number, or your own sticker/barcode) we will append that to the filename after the BAVC barcode. The [Preservation files](https://bavc.github.io/bavc-resources/docs/CollectionHolderInfo/PreservationFormats.html) have no extra suffix appended to them. Mezzanine and Access files do have an identifying suffix appended to the filename.

Collection holders can also provide BAVC with a spreadsheet containing a "Filename Root" field for each tape. If this information is provided the Filename Root will appended to the filename after the barcode.

If you prefer that we remove the BAVC Barcode number from the files before delivery please let us know at the start of your project. We're happy to do this, and require that you provide either your own Unique Identifier or Filename Root for each tape.

BAVC can also provide custom suffxes to any file deliverable. Again, this must be agreed upon at the onset of the project.

### Examples

This is an example of what a set of Preservation, Mezzanine, and Access files with no supplied identifier from the collection holder. This this case the BAVC barcode number is BAVC1012345:

* **Preservation File:** BAVC1012345.mov
* **Mezzanine File:** BAVC1012345_mezzanine.mov
* **Access File:** BAVC1012345_access.mp4

This is an example of what a set of Preservation, Mezzanine, and Access files with a supplied identifier from the collection holder. This this case the Unique Identifier is SFJAZZ_102933 BAVC barcode number is BAVC1012345:

* **Preservation File:** BAVC1012345_SFJAZZ_102933.mov
* **Mezzanine File:** BAVC1012345_SFJAZZ_102933_mezzanine.mov
* **Access File:** BAVC1012345_SFJAZZ_102933_access.mp4

This is an example of what a set of Preservation, Mezzanine, and Access files with a supplied Filename Root from the collection holder and custom suffixes. This this case the Filename Root is AV_CAM_01429 and the BAVC barcode number is BAVC1012345. This collection holder as asked that all preservation files and in "prsv", all mezzanine files end in "m" and all access files in "a":

* **Preservation File:** BAVC1012345_AV_CAM_01429_prsv.mov
* **Mezzanine File:** BAVC1012345_AV_CAM_01429_m.mov
* **Access File:** BAVC1012345_AV_CAM_01429_a.mp4

The second two of the above three examples may have the BAVC Barcode removed before delivery.
