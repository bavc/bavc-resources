# Creating Subtitles and Transcripts using Sonix.AI

Any instructional videos we make should have subtitles. Also, some collection holders may ask for transcripts of their materials. Sonix.AI can be used to create these transcripts and subtitles.

## Make a Purchase Request First

Sonix charges about $5 per hour. be sure to create a Purchase Request and get it approved by finance first, especially if you plan to make transcriptions of hundreds of hours of content for a collection holder


## Uploading videos

Go to [https://sonix.ai/](https://sonix.ai/) and log in using BAVC's username. Once you're logged in your can upload any file you want. Please only upload _Access_ files, since Pres and Mezzanine files are way too large.

## Editing Transcripts

Sonix isn't perfect, and will likely need some editing. For huge projects the editing will be minimal, but for instructional videos you should go through and make sure everything is correct.

Once the video is marked _Transcribed_ you can edit the transcription. Click on the file to open the editor. Sonix has a built-in editing tool you can use to edit everything. It can be difficult to get used to, but there are tools that change the playback speed and help search for text that can be very helpful.

## Exporting Transcripts

Once you're done editing, you can export the transcript as various formats.

For instructional videos you should export as SRT. Learnworlds only accepts SRT files for captioning.

For preservation job you should as the collection holder what format they want. SRT and WebVTT are the most common.
