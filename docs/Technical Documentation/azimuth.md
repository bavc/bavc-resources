# Adjusting Azimuth for Audio Tape Recordings

Azimuth adjustments must be made for every audiocassette and open reel audio tape we transfer. Adjusting the azimuth ensures maximum head alignment, and gets the best sounding transfers.

For more information about why we adjust azimuth and more details about how to do it check out this [excellent article on the topic](https://richardhess.com/notes/2006/09/27/azimuth-hows-and-whys/)

## General Adjust Azimuth

The best way to perform azimuth adjustments is by monitoring the audio in mono, and then turning the adjustment screw until you hear the best high frequency response.

It is _**very important**_ that you only make quarter turns in either direction. You should never turn the screw a full 360˚ in either direction, or you risk stripping or removing the screw. The adjustments are usually rather fine, and so turning about 90˚ in either direction should be sufficient.

When using reaper, put the main output in Mono mode by pressing the button on the Master fader that looks like two circles and says "Mono" under it. This does not change the recording to mono, but it forces the main output to be mono. Once the main output is mono, you can turn the azimuth screw listen to the high frequencies. If you're listening to music, the cymbals of the drums will become far more clear. If you're listening to talking it might be harder to hear, but the sound in general should become less muddy. This is generally easier to do with headphones, rather than speakers.

Seeking out specific content like applause or similar sounds can be very helpful, since there's lots of high frequencies in that kind of content.  

Make sure that any Dolby Noise Reduction is OFF when performing azimuth adjustments, even if the tape does have Dolby NR recorded on it.

Below we'll describe which screws to turn for each of our decks.

## Tascam 122Mkiii Adjustments

For all our Tascam decks we replace the typical Philips azimuth screw with a torx style screw. These types of screws are less likely to strip and easier to use. We purchase the screws from Fastener-Express. This is the part number: M2 x .4 x 8mm Pan Head Star (Torx Style) Socket Screws A2 Stainless MPTS208-9N4.

The screwdriver you'll want to use is the _t6 x 30mm_ screw. The one from the small screwdriver kit has a pink bottom. 

The screw is only accessible when the deck is in play mode. The azimuth screw is the bottom screw on the right side of the playhead.

A word of warning: Make sure to remove the screw driver before pressing Stop. The 122 will retract the head stack when you hit stop, and if the screwdriver is in there it could potential damage the deck.

## Otari MX-55 Adjustments

On the MX-55 the playhead is the rightmost head. There are three heads total. From left to right they are:
* Erase Head
* Record Head
* Playback Head

The Azimuth screw is the Hex screw immediately to the right of the play head (3rd head from left).

## Otari MX-5050 Adjustments

The MX-5050 has two playback heads. One is for quarter-track and one is for half-track. There are four heads total. From left to right they are:

* Erase Head
* Quarter-Track Playback Head
* Half-Track Record Head
* Half-Track Playback Head

If you are playing a quarter-track tape, adjust the silver hex screw immediately to the right of the Quarter-Track Playback Head (2nd head from left)

If you are playing a half-track tape, adjust the silver hex screw immediately to the right of the Half-Track Playback Head (4th head from left)
