# Intake/Inspection

## Potential Setbacks

* Tapes are not barcoded properly; mold and conditions that impair playback are not noted; labels are lost; incorrect information is logged into Salesforce.

## Recommended Assurance

* Perform intake in three steps. First, prep the tapes: apply barcode, perform a condition inspection, remove write-protect tab, and tape down loose labels with paper tape. When all of the tapes are prepped, go back and enter the data in Salesforce. Finally, bag moldy tapes with desiccants and store tapes vertically This method gives you a second chance to spot discrepancies (missing barcodes, etc.)

When entering data in Salesforce, NEVER guess. Always ask if you are unclear about how to describe an item. It is always better to leave a field blank than to misdirect the next person with a barely informed hypothesis.

# Conservation Treatment

## Potential Setbacks

* Tapes are left in the oven too long and/or to hot; tapes are baked/clean more than necessary or not at all; cleaning machines "eat" or break tapes; tapes sent to Peter Brothers for mold treatment are lost/forgotten by Peter Brothers; mold on tapes increases and/or spreads to other tapes in the collection while in storage; sticky shed syndrome intensifies in storage.

## Recommended Assurance

* All conservation treatment and activities should be logged in the object's preservation record in Salesforce to prevent duplicate efforts and confusion. Every clean and bake should be logged in the 'Preservation Activities" module. Our ovens have their temperatures locked in to prevent changes; if you'd like to change the oven temperature, please talk to your supervisor.

To avoid the spread of mold, any tape suspected of mold should be sealed in a ziploc bag with desiccants. The tape should remain that way until it has been determined either that there is no mold, or it has been treated by Peter Brothers.

Peter Brothers runs a small, high-volume operation and does not have the staff to accurately track the move of materials. The onus is on us to make sure he has received the tape and servicing us in a timely manner. Whenever a tape is sent to Spec Bros for mold treatment, the activity should be logged in the Activity module of Salesforce. Attach a record of the FedEx tracking number and note the estimated arrival of the tape. When the tape has arrived according to FedEx, call Peter and make sure the package was received. Follow up with him every two weeks on the status of the service.
