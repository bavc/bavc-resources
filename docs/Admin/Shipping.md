# Shipping

## Shipping Protocols

* Ship FedEx or UPS only (2nd Day is recommended, Ground if the client understands the risks)
* Shipping often requires a separate invoice, be sure they pay it before returning the materials
* Request that tracking notifications be sent to both you and the client
* Schedule UPS and FedEx to pickup the package here. Smaller FedEx packages can be dropped off at the box on Folsom and 18th Street. FedEx packages can also be dropped off at Office Max on Harrison.
* The hard drive and the tapes should be shipped separately
  * If the client has only paid a portion of what they owe, we sometimes ship the tapes back first to free up space and hold onto the drive until they complete payment
* Do not use styrofoam popcorn as packing material, it flakes and can get trapped in the tape containers
* Avoid using paper as a packing material, it can create a static charge
* Bubble wrap and air packs are the best for packing
* Tapes with loose labels should be wrapped in bubble wrap
  Tapes that were treated for mold need to be shipped out in a plastic bag with desiccants.
* A packing list should always be included in shipment. Currently this is done by generating a Shipping Log for the shipment. (the opportunity should have a ship log before being closed out)


## Creating and Printing Labels

* Go to FedEx.com
* Login in using our FedEx account
* Click the "Shipping" tab at the top of the page
* Click "Create a shipment"
* Check and see if a Shipment Profile already exists, if so that makes filling out the rest easier.
* Here's how to fill out the sections:
  * 1) From:
    * Morgan Oscar Morel, 2727 Mariposa St FL 2, San Francisco, California, 94110, United States
  * 2) To:
    * The shipping address of the client
    * You can find this in Salesforce. Go to the opportunity, then the quote, and find the shipping address. If it's empty ask the Pres Director for help
  * 3) Package Details
    * Set the ship date to whenever it will ship. If you're packing on a Thursday or Friday set the ship date to the next businesses day (typically the following Monday)
    * Fill out the physical details about the package
    * Tapes need to ALWAYS be sent FedEx 2-day unless otherwise requested
  * 4) Billing Details
    * Unless otherwise requested, BAVC will pay shipping.
    * Bill Transport To: BAVC-846
    * Your reference: Paste in the quote number associated with the opportunity.
    * Pickup/Drop-off
    * Make sure to schedule a pickup unless otherwise requested. It's best to ship a few things at once if possible because the pickups cost us $10.
  * 5) Shipment Notifications
    * Sender Email: morgan@bavc.org
    * Recipient Email: The the client's email from Salesforce
    * Check the following boxes
      * Ship
      * Pickup (unless dropping off package at FedEx location)
      * Delivery
* With that all filled out you can hit "Ship"
* Double check the label to make sure everything is ok.
* Before printing make sure that you have a FedEx printer label loaded into the printer.
* FedEx printer labels can be used. In order to have them oriented properly please load the label sheets with the FedEx logo Up (facing you) and on the right side of the sheet.
* Print a second label and include it in the box. That way if the label falls off the box there is a second inside the box.
