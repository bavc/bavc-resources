# Packing Tapes

Packing tapes at a controlled tension and speed redistributes tape pack stresses and creates an even tension during playback. For tapes with heavy cinching, windows or other pack problems, this process can be repeated as often as needed.

* **1 inch**
    - We currently do not pack 1 inch tapes for safety reasons

* **1/2 inch**
    - Remove lid of 1/2" cleaning deck
    - Ensure that a 1/4" audio reel is in place on right side of deck to support take up reel
    - Turn on deck
    - Ensure tension pin is blocked
    - Chose a take up reel which corresponds in size with the reel you wish to clean
    - Thread source tape anti clockwise around take up reel's hub directly across top of deck  - DO NOT thread through tape path
    - Put control in FORWARD position
    - Once tape has finished forwarding, thread back on to source reel and rewind entirely

* **Cassette Based Formats**
    - Ensure deck tape path is clean
    - Place tape in deck
    - Fast-forward
    - Rewind
