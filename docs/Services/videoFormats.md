# Video Formats

## 2" Quadraplex
We do not transfer 2". We sub-contract to Larry Odham in Tennessee

## 1" Video

* CAUTION! Don't slow down or use shuttle while playing or TAPE WILL BREAK
* Don't pack tapes (for safety)
* Leave empty reel on deck when not in use
* 3rd audio channel is timecode
* BVH-2000 deck plays type C
* Take cover screws off to use deck, lock reel on left side
* For right pickup reel use large hub
* Shuttle to rewind and FF - turn all the way, don't adjust speed
* Shuttle a 2nd time to get tape off reel

## 1/2" Open Reel

* No time code
* Watch for dropouts, creases in tape
* Squealing or sticky tape should be stopped and baked before playback
* One audio and one video channel
* Don't stop tape immediately if tape appears to be over - watch remainder of tape to ensure there is no further content
* CV vs AV: CV tape is unbacked, appearing shiny on both sides. While this is occasionally the case for AV tapes, a lack of backing is a good indicator that a tape is CV
* If there are heavy dropouts, utilize either of the two TBCs with dropout correctors (DOC). Make sure to connect RF out of the deck to the RF scope, and make sure the scope is connected to the correct TBC
    - BVT-800
        - Make sure the advanced sync from the BVT is connected to the Video In of the deck
    - DPS-290
        - The Video In of the deck can be connected to the general blackburst in the rack
        - The DOC can be tuned with a trim pot inside the TBC. Do this if you see lots of weird lines instead of a clear picture
