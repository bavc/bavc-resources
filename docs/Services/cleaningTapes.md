    - Fold a DRY cotton swatch over exposed tape between reels and pinch lightly
    - Put control in FORWARD position
    - Allow tape to run through pinched fingers, applying even pressure
    - Pause occasionally and check level of dirt being removed
    - Replace dirty cloth with fresh cloth as often as necessary while cleaning

    - Once tape has self ejected following cleaning, use dentist's mirror to check how much dirt has been removed by cleaning rolls
    - If cleaning rolls has removed a lot of dirt, repeat cleaning procedure
    - If cleaning roll is collecting thick, sticky detritus, you should bake tape
