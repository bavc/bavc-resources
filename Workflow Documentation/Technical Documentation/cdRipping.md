# CD Ripping

## Required Software

* XLD
   - You can install by either:
   - Installing the DMG file from [this site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xld/files/xld-20220917.dmg)
   - If you have homebrew install you can run the command `brew install xld`

This page is mostly incomplete, and is just a landing page for research on the topic.

There are generally 2 types of CDs: CD-ROM and CD-DA. CD-ROMs contain an imaged volume with data, and can generally be treated like DVDs but with slightly different ripping parameters. CD-DAs contain just audio, and need to be ripped with special software. Here are the two front-runners in the research:

XLD - X Lossless Decoder. This seems to be the best bet for ripping using a Mac. More research and testing needs to be done, but it can be installed using homebrew (brew install xld) which is a big plus.
EAC - Exact Audio Copy. This is used by a lot of people in the field, but is only available on PC
